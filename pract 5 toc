Aim: Write a program to perform tokenization of given input.
CODE:
import nltk
nltk.download()
sentence_data="You're braver than you believe. You must be the change you wish to see in the world"
nltk_tokens=nltk.sent_tokenize(sentence_data)
print(nltk_tokens)
Output:


Word tokenization:
Code:
import nltk
nltk.download()
sentence_data="You're braver than you believe. You must be the change you wish to see in the world"
nltk_tokens=nltk.word_tokenize(sentence_data)
print(nltk_tokens)
